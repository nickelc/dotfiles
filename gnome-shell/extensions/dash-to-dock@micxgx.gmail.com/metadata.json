This extension moves the dash out of the overview transforming it in a dock for an easier launching of applications and a faster switching between windows and desktops.\n\nIF THE EXTENSION FAILS TO INSTALL, PLEASE, TRY TO RELOAD THE SHELL FIRST AND TRY AGAIN. APOLOGIES FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. I STILL CAN'T REPRODUCE THE BUG ON MY SETUP, BUT I'M WORKING ON IT.\n\nTHE EXTENSION CAN ALSO BE INSTALLED MANUALLY FROM THE EXTENSION HOMEPAGE.",
