Please copy the file 
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/cpupower@mko-sl.de/mko.cpupower.policy 
to /usr/share/polkit-1/actions

To do so, you can use the following command:
sudo cp ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/cpupower@mko-sl.de/mko.cpupower.policy
/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/

Remember to change the owner and permissions of the cpufreqctl tool:
sudo chown root:root ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/cpupower@mko-sl.de/cpufreqctl
sudo chmod 0555 ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/cpupower@mko-sl.de/cpufreqctl

After you did this, restart gnome-shell.
